# MatStatistics-DiscoverTypeCorelation
This software is written in Python using the PYSide6 library and developed with the graphical editor QtDesigner.
# How to use :
To conduct data analysis, you need a dependency matrix between two statistical variables. 
You can either load this matrix from a file named "Data.txt" or modify it by running the program and clicking on "Modify Data."
Then you can enter your matrix in the window. Afterwards, you will build a graph, and based on the graph, you can draw conclusions about 
the type of correlation. You can then find the coefficients of the equation, compute the variance of variable
Y with respect to the regression curve Y on X, and calculate the sum of squared deviations from the conditional means.
